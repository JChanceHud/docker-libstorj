[![Storj.io](https://storj.io/img/storj-badge.svg)](https://storj.io)

This is a prebuilt docker image including the compiled [libstorj](https://github.com/Storj/libstorj) executable.

## Usage

This image is primarily intended for use inside docker swarms to provide a persistent storage that can be authenticated by environment variables provided at runtime as [secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/).

Configurations for various services (mongo, redis, custom servers) can be stored securely in storj and accessed at runtime via authentication stored in the network in a custom entrypoint script.

## Command line use

This docker image can be used to play with the storj executable without installing onto your local machine.

```
docker run --rm jchancehud/libstorj storj --help
```
